assignment-4
============
For this assignment, you should implement a module that solves a problem related to either polygons or range searching; or implements some sort of sweep line method.

# Projects

### [`region-quadtree-2d`](https://github.com/melanz/region-quadtree-2d)

Author: Daniel Melanz

The region quadtree represents a partition of space in two dimensions by decomposing the region into four equal quadrants, subquadrants, and so on with each leaf node containing data corresponding to a specific subregion.

### sweep-line-test

Author: Andrew Seidl

Line segment intersection using a sweep line test.

# Ideas

* Robust point in polygon tests using exact arithmetic
* Sweep line test to find crossings between line segments
* Other sweep-line algorithms; ie report all box overlaps.
* Fast point in polygon tests for special kinds of shapes (convex, star shaped, monotone, etc.)
* Optimized kdtrees or range trees for arbitrary dimensions

# What you need to do
